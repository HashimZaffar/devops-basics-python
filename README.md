Absolutely 👍
Below is a **clean, professional, beginner-friendly README** you can copy-paste **entirely** into your repository.
This is written exactly in a way **recruiters like** for junior/entry DevOps portfolios.

# DevOps Basics with Python Automation

This is my first DevOps portfolio project.  
It demonstrates basic DevOps concepts using **Python scripting**, **terminal usage**, and **automation principles**.

The goal of this project is to show how repetitive system tasks can be automated using simple Python scripts — a core DevOps skill.

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

This Python script performs the following actions automatically:

- Creates a directory on the system
- Creates a file inside that directory
- Writes content into the file
- Verifies whether the directory already exists

This simulates a real-world DevOps scenario where manual system tasks are automated.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **macOS Terminal (Unix-based)**
- **Git & GitHub**
- Python standard library (`os` module)

No external libraries are used.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HashimZaffar/devops-basics-python.git
cd devops-basics-python
````

### 2️⃣ Run the script

```bash
python3 file_manager.py
```

---

## 📤 Output

After running the script, the following will be created automatically:

```
example_directory/
└── example.txt
```

The file contains text written by the Python script.

## 💡 Why This Project Matters (DevOps Context)

In DevOps, engineers automate system-level tasks to reduce manual effort and errors.

This project demonstrates:

* Automation mindset
* Basic system interaction using Python
* Clean project structure
* Version control with Git

These skills are fundamental for DevOps, Cloud, and SRE roles.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for learning purposes:

* Accept directory and file names as command-line arguments
* Add logging instead of print statements
* Add error handling
* Create a system monitoring script (CPU, memory, disk)
* Dockerize the script
* Add CI/CD using GitHub Actions
